# VIT-Grade-Predictor
VIT Grade Predictor is a machine learning application to predict the grade for a course based on the marks obtained in internal tests and lab assessments.

The grade predictor application is developed using data about various courses collected from students of VIT, Vellore through a survey. The data collected contains details about the marks obtained by students in the various components of a course, such as theory internals, lab assessments and project, and the corresponding grade obtained foir that course.

Using this data, a Decision Tree classifier model is trained to predict the grade for a new course based on the input for marks obtained in the various compoents mentioned.
